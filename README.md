# Plumber game with user interface
January 2024 (M1 BI)

## Introduction

This project aims to write a java application, using the swing library, that allows you to
play the game **Plumber**. The game has a graphical interface, meaning it can be played using only a mouse.

The goal is to link a series of pipes in such a way that they are all connected to each other, without any of them being open to the outside of the board.
The central pipe is red, indicating that the water flow passes through it. You have to turn the pipes until they're all red. The game contains a dozen levels of increasing difficulty.

## Setup

To install the algorithm and its dependencies, you need to perform the following steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gloriabenoit/Plumber-Game.git

cd Plumber-Game
```
